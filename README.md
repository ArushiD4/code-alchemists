26002 - Emergency Response Systems
Delayed Emergency Medical Response in Urban and Semi-Urban India Timely emergency medical response is critical in saving lives during accidents, cardiac arrests, trauma incidents, and other life-threatening conditions. However, in many Indian cities and semi-urban regions, emergency response systems face significant challenges including traffic congestion, lack of real-time coordination, uneven ambulance distribution, and limited visibility into hospital capacity.
Timely emergency medical response is critical in saving lives during accidents, cardiac arrests, trauma incidents, and other life-threatening conditions. However, in many Indian cities and semi-urban regions, emergency response systems face significant challenges including traffic congestion, lack of real-time coordination, uneven ambulance distribution, and limited visibility into hospital capacity.

Delays in patient triage and ambulance dispatch often result in critical loss of treatment time, especially during peak traffic hours, large public gatherings, natural disasters, or multi-casualty incidents. Additionally, emergency call centers may struggle to prioritize cases efficiently due to limited structured decision-support mechanisms.

Key systemic gaps include: * Lack of dynamic coordination between emergency callers, ambulances, and hospitals * Limited real-time traffic and route optimization integration * Absence of structured prioritization during high-load scenarios * Poor interoperability between emergency services and healthcare facilities * Inadequate preparedness for surge situations (disasters, mass accidents, public events)
Lack of dynamic coordination between emergency callers, ambulances, and hospitals

Limited real-time traffic and route optimization integration

Absence of structured prioritization during high-load scenarios

Poor interoperability between emergency services and healthcare facilities

Inadequate preparedness for surge situations (disasters, mass accidents, public events)

Challenge Statement Design a scalable and intelligent emergency response framework that improves response time, optimizes resource allocation, and enhances coordination between emergency services and healthcare facilities under real-world constraints.
